	elm_character (Happy): Maybe taking a break from studying isn't so bad after all. You guys aren't as uneducated as I thought.
	periwinkle_character: Don't be mean Elm!
	elm_character: Ahem, what I meant was that I think seahorses and penguins are pretty cool too. Did you know that seahorse are weak swimmers? They don't go very fast despite being a fish. 
	elm_character: And also, did you know a long long time ago that giant penguins existed! They were super duper tall and heavy, imagine hugging a giant penguin like that.
	summer_character: Woah!! That's so cool! I wish I could go back in time to see that.
	albert_character: Haha, you're such a nerd! I probably swim better than seahorses!
	elm_character: Anyways, I'm sorry for being mean to you the other day Periwinkle. Sometimes I let my ego get the best of me.
	periwinkle_character: It's okay Elm, I forgive you. It was lonely without my best friend.
	summer_character: But now you have all of us! We'll be friends forever!
	albert_character: Yeah!!!!
	elm_character: Thanks for helping me guys, I see what I've beeing out on.
	ELM HAS JOINED THE PARTY.
	summer_character: I've got one more person to help out! Will you guys lend me a hand?
	albert_character: Yeah! What are friends for!
	periwinkle_character: Of course! We'd love to!
	elm_character: With our combined intellect and lack therof and strength there's nothing that can stop us!
	summer_character: Thanks guys! Let's go talk to my big sister!

	elm_character (Sad): Seven times nine is... seven times nine is... seven times nine is.... sixty - you made me lose count! Now I have to start over again.
	elm_character (Sad): I can't afford to get distraced this time.
